    <h2><em>What is CSS?</em></h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</li><br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li><br>
        <li><b style="text-decoration: line-through";> CSS is not neccesary</b>
            <b><span style="background-color: yellow";>CSS saves a lot of work.</span></b>
            <span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</span></li><br>
        <li style="text-decoration:underline; font-style:italic";>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>

    </ol>
    <h2 style="font-style:italic; color: rgb(211, 6, 6)" >CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
        <ul type="disc" style="color: rgb(192, 10, 10)">
        <li> Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section </li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <b><span style="background-color: yellow";>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span></b>because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can see use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript.</p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific elelment or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
